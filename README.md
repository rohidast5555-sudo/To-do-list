# To-do-list
📝 Professional To-Do List Manager

A simple and efficient command-line To-Do List Manager built in Python.
Easily manage your daily tasks — add, view, remove, and clear them right from your terminal.

🚀 Features

✅ Add new tasks

🧠 How It Works

The program reads your tasks from a file called todo-list.
